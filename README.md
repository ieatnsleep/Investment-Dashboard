# Portfolio Dashboard - Investment Performance Analysis

Welcome to my Portfolio Dashboard repository. This dashboard showcases my personal investment portfolio performance using a dynamic Tableau dashboard. The purpose of this dashboard is to highlight key financial insights derived from my investment, including overall portfolio performance, solely for the purpose of analysis and visualization. 
This is non a financial advice.
